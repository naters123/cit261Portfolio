    <h2>Further Functions</h2>
    <p>
      Looking at the list I have no idea what promise, async, closure, currying, or project are as they related to functions.
      This chapter should be eye opening. Length can be used to see the number of paramerters accepted. I am realizing that funtions in 
      Javascript are far more dynamic than any other language I have used (maybe too dynamic). Caching function results is 
      something I didn't know could be done so that is ineresting object.cache.  

    </p>
    <p class="code">
      &nbsp;function party() {<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;console.log('Wow this is amazing!');<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;party = function(){<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;console.log('Been there, got the T-Shirt');<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
          &nbsp;}<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      A function redfining itself (like the one above) is an interesting concept. I think it could come in handy
      for an onload function that does something different if it is the first time the program runs. I already understand recursion
      although I am not a fan of using it, it works extremely well for certain tasks. Callback Hell is an interesting term. I have
      both produced code that qualified, but these days I heavily try to avoid it when possible. Promises seem like a unique solution.
    </p>
    <p class="code">
      &nbsp;const promise = new Promise( (resolve, reject) => {<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;// initialization code goes here<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;if (success) {<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;resolve(value);<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;} else {<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reject(error);<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
        &nbsp;});<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Returning functions is also a neat concept, I could see it being useful for writing cleaner looking code. Pure functions look useful,
      seems like many Javascript built in functions are Pure Functions.
    </p>

    <h2>AJAX</h2>
    <p>
      We have used AJAX before and it is incredibly useful for 3rd party API and other stuff. I didn't know the name came from Asynchronous 
      JavaScript XML. JSON is heavily used with AJAX since it is lightweight and easy to use. Not much else needs to be said, but I would like
      to have a copy of a full AJAX request here just for reference. 
    </p>
    <p class="code">
      &nbsp;const url = 'https:example.com/data';<br>
      &nbsp;const headers = new Headers({ 'Content-Type': 'text/plain', 'Accept-Charset' :<br> &nbsp;'utf-8', 'Accept-Encoding':'gzip,deflate' })<br>

      &nbsp;const request = (url,{<br>
        &nbsp;headers: headers<br>
          &nbsp;})<br>

          &nbsp;fetch(request)<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;.then( function(response) {<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if(response.ok) {<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return response;<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;throw Error(response.statusText);<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;})<br>
              &nbsp;.then( response => // do something with response )<br>
              &nbsp;.catch( error => console.log('There was an error!') )<br>
    </p>
