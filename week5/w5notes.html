    <h2>Testing and Debugging</h2>
    <p>
      I feel like most of my experience has been from writing code, and I rarely spend my time testing and debugging, which is not good. 
      This section will be very useful to me. It is interesting that they promote code that will "fail loudly" when something goes wrong. 
      Which makes sense, since that way the bugs will at least be easy to spot when they do as opposed to silently in the background. Strict
      mode is something I didn't know about and is pretty interesting.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Checking if certain API's are being used by the users browsers is something I have never thought of but seems useful depending on the 
      project. I didn't know you could set breakpoints, which is also nice to know. Try catches are something I am used to but don't really 
      know when to use them. I have done some test driven development which I thought was pretty useful not only for writting code with (hopefully)
      fewer bugs, but also acting as checkpoints for finishing a part of the project.
