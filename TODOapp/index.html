    <p>I have two ideas for a web application:</p>
    <h2>
      Platformer Game Online Portfolio
    </h2>
    <p>
      This application would be a platformer game (similar to the classic mario bros) with original characters.
      This game would allow the user of the site to run around and play in a 2D world that showcases some of the 
      projects I have worked on in the past. This is opposed to a typical online portfolio that just details the 
      projects, this would be a more fun way for potential employers to see what I can do while looking at my previous
      projects. This may be a bit more than I could do, but it looks fun. If I make a very simple game I think it is
      plausible though. The video below inspired the idea:

    <h2>
      Fridge Storage/Recipe Application
    </h2>
    <p>
      The other idea was to create an application that can keep track of food in the fridge for you. 
      The user will enter what they have in the fridge (name, description, expiration date) and then
      the data will be stored locally. The app would use an api to grab nutritional information on known
      foods and I wanted to make the app automatically suggest recipies based on what is in the fridge.
      It would also alert the user if food expires, or if food should be eaten soon. This is a nice
      oriject that would implement most of the grading material.
