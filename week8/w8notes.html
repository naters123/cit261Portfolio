    <h2>CSS3 Transforms and Transitions</h2>
    <p>
      These are some of the css properties I struggle with so this should be good. It looks like translate does what I was
      using negative margins for all along.. this makes me a bit sad since that is always buggy. Below I am going to 
      list the syntax so I can remember. Scale seems straightforward, I think it would be useful too for some media queries. 
      Rotate seems fun :) I could see it being very useful to create patterns in the web page. Skew is also fun, could be useful
      for certain applications and hover effects on images. "However, if you gave your circle or ellipse a transform-origin of 10% 10% 
      or top center" it changes everything, good to know. I agree where it talks about CSS animations being more useful than javascript
      when possible, this has been my experience as well. I am very familiar with transition, I use it quite often. I feel like all the
      examples and topics in it are self explanitory. Keyframes is all new information to me.
    </p>
    <p class="code">
      <!-- &nbsp; -->
      <br>
      transform: translate(45px, -45px);<br>
      transform: translateX(45px);<br>
      transform: translateY(-30px);<br><br>
      transform: scale(1.5, 0.25);<br>
      transform: scale(0.25);<br><br>
      transform-origin: 0 0;<br><br>
      transition: transform 0.2s ease-out 50ms;<br>
    </p>
    <h2>Canvas, SVG, and Drag and Drop</h2>
    <p>
      I have very little experience with canvas so this should be interesting too. **Some of the notes I take are just going to be following
      the example on the example below** seems like canvas overall is very dynamic and has many visual uses for both videos and images or
      even pattern design on the site. Seems like canvas is less dynamic while the site is up compated to svg, but uses less resources while
      the site is up. Drag and drop was barely touched on, I think I will do some additional reading later. 
    </p>
    <canvas id="myCanvas" class="myCanvas" width="500" height="500">
      Sorry! Your browser doesnâ€™t support Canvas.
    </canvas>

  </div>
</body>
<script>
  var canvas = document.getElementById("myCanvas");
  var context = canvas.getContext("2d");
  context.strokeStyle = "red";
  context.fillStyle = "rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.5)";
  context.fillRect(10, 10, 100, 100);   
  context.strokeRect(10, 10, 100, 100);
