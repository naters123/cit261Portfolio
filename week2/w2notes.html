      Although chapter 2 was mostly review, I found the template literals section to be pretty useful.
      I had no idea you could perform actual arithmetic functions within strings as well as other things.
      This would have made some of my projects for the previous web development class a lot more dynamic
      and easy. I also learned that exponents can be done with a ** instead of a call to a function, which
      is pretty cool.

      From chapter 3, I didn't know what memory leaks were, but now I have a basic idea and how to prevent them with weak data structures.
      Seems as though the rest is largely just review, but that's not really a bad thing. The arguments variable is a neat one that I have never seen before.
      I think it would be very useful in some situations. I also didn't know there was such a thing as a variable amount of arguments or default args.

      As I was going through chapter 4 I didn't see anything particularly difficult to understand,
      or something I haven't yet encountered. I didn't know about function hoisting, but it looks
      like something that can be worked around. Not really something I need to use for certain.
