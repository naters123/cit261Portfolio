    Although chapter 2 was mostly review, I found the template literals section to be pretty useful.
    I had no idea you could perform actual arithmetic functions within strings as well as other things.
    This would have made some of my projects for the previous web development class a lot more dynamic
    and easy. I also learned that exponents can be done with a ** instead of a call to a function, which
    is pretty cool.
