    <h2>Object Methods</h2>
    <p>
      Looking at the first example shows me just how flexible Javascript is by adding a function to the object after the object has already been declared.
      I am familiar a bit with the concept of "this" from C++ and a few other languages, so some of this feels like review. I did find it interesting that
      using this is evaluated during run time, it looks like it allows for some very dynamic factory functions and other things. I think the important thing
      to remember is that 'this' is free. From the exercises I see that I need to use 'this' in a method or else it may have an undefined value.
    </p>
    <h2>This</h2>
    <p>
      Of the six it sounds like the Window object should really be used by calling this. The second way is similar to how I used this is C++ so I can understand it being
      useful for determining which variable with the same name is which. The next few recap what the other article mentioned but I still think they are useful to hear from 
      a different perspective. I find it confusing as to why the arrow function works differently, I thought the functions were the same. Bind is interesting and I am wondering
      when I would be using it. The examples with bind were pretty consfusing. 
    </p>
    <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
    <p>
      The example near the top just answered one of my questions as to why sometimes in javascript setting css properties on an element are in quotes and some arent. I 
      didn't know you could access object elements with brackets so that is neat to see. Overall it seems the properties and tools for objects in JavaScript are vastly 
      different than I am used to from other languages. It almost seems like it is too adaptable. It is weird and also useful that properties can be added to objects after they
      have been declared. Its good to know that objects are copied by reference not by value. JSON was a review, but it was nice to have a refresher. The math object seems
      pretty standard, and so does the date object.
    </p>
    <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
    <p>
      I have read about the dom before but I didn't understand it too well, the review is nice. The explaination here shows that things are part of a hiercial web, which is 
      easy for me to follow. I didn't know you could make a list of every type of element on the page and then do something with them, I could see that being handy at some point. 
      I see a lot of useful tricks for using Javascript with the HTML. I think of all the chapters so far this one is the one I want to remember as a reference. 
    </p>
    <h2>Chapter 7</h2>
    <p>
      Event listeners are useful for making the code dynamic and adding a lot of interactivity. I thought this chapter was very useful overall, but a lot of review for me. I did 
      not know there was an event for double clicking so I thought that was pretty useful. Even coordinates are also something I didn't know existed so I thought they were cool. I don't 
      know why but while reading this I made the connection that chrome extensions could just be injected javascript code using event listeners and dom to do all sorts of things. Creating events
      for screen swiping was an interesting aside that I had never considered. Event delegation is also a neat tool.
