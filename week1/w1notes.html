    I like how they mentioned starting from the 
    smallest screen and then working up. This makes me 
    also wonder if it is best to develop without css and 
    then add it after the html page is done. It is also 
    interesting how it talks about going from almost 
    exclusively desktop to mobile.

    I agree with helping the user right away. My clients often like
    having a call to action button on each page of thier site. I also like
    to make it easy to use on mobile devices since thats what everyone uses these days.
    I have often neglected resizing my images but I can see how it helps with SEO and speed.

    I liked the section on forms. I did have a question about how to 
    avoid robotic messages from forms which it didn't really answer. The rest
    was very straight forward.
