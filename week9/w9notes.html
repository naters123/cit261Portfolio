    <h1>Notes for Week 09</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>The Window Object</h2>
    <p>
      The BOM is something I am somewhat familiar with. I have used alert(), confirm() and prompt() before, but I feel like there 
      are usually better ways to do what those functions offer. They are convient however. I didn't think about the fact that they
      stop programs dead in their tracks, that makes them even less usefull most of the time. I suppose this could be useful for 
      certain applications though. The window.location property could be usful for making sites more dynamic. The brower histoy
      could be useful for making custom back or foward buttons in the application or when tasks of some sort are completed and 
      we want to automatically redirect the user to where they were. The screen object seems very useful for certain applications too.
      I am familiar with cookies and the DOM so I wont take as much notes about it. I knew timing functions were possible but I didn't know
      the syntax so I will keep it here. We also went over animations last week so I wont say much about those either.
    </p>
    <p class="code">
      <!-- &nbsp; -->
      <br>
      window.history.go(1); // goes forward 1 page<br>
      window.history.go(0); // reloads the current page<br>
      window.history.go(-1); // goes back 1 page<br><br>
      window.setTimeout( () => alert("Time's Up!"), 3000);<br><br>

    </p>
    <h2>HTML5 APIs</h2>
    <p>
      I have only used the data attribute a handful of times but it has been useful. Custom attributes can make the program very
      flexible. The vast amount of features from HTML 5 are honestly pretty impressive. The web storage could be super useful for certain
      things, I could also see it being a security risk too though. Local storage should be useful for most web applications I would think.
      The only downside is you cant use that info on another device if needed. Geolocation seems invasive. The web sockets could be very useful,
      I could see a game of chess being played through something like this. The notifications section is exactly what I'm going to need for my
      final project so I will save this section. I didn't know the aduio and video tags were so new.
    </p>
    <p class="code">
      <!-- &nbsp; -->
      <br>
      if(window.Notification) {<br>
        Notification.requestPermission();<br>
    }<br><br>
