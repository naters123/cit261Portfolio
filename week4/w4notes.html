    <h2>Forms</h2>
    <p>
      I am pretty familiar with forms and have used them a fair amount in the previous course. It does mention a bit about Ruby as an alternative to PHP.
      This had me wondering why we use PHP since not many people I know like it. I would much prefer to use Python for its readability, but maybe that is 
      just because I don't have a lot of experience with PHP. The different ways to search for a form in javascript is pretty useful although I usually like
      to use the getElementsByTagname method personally. Auto focus is a neat property and could be useful depending on the site. Looking at the different
      input forms, I was able to see how some sites toggle password visibility on and off through a button, which is to just toggle the input type on a 
      button click. I learned the real difference between radio and check boxes is that only one radio field can be selected.

    <h2>Object Oriented Programming</h2>
    <p>
      I have done a decent amount of object oriented programming by now and I find it quite enjoyable. A lot of these concepts are review but very useful still
      for the refresher. Constructors are functions I am familiar with too. I have decided I like the ES6 Class Declaration syntax the most since I am familiar
      with it. Using the constructor property is an interesting concept and seems confusing in the example. The static keyword is different than what I am used to 
      prototype is a concept I am not too familiar with with Javascript, I think I should do at least one exercise using it. Factory functions is an awesome section 
      although I sometimes have trouble wrapping my mind around the concept.
    </p>
    <h2>Modern Javascript</h2>
    <p>
      jQuery is awesome and has a lot of uses for making creating pages faster. Although I agree with the reading that they do add a lot of overhead which can be a problem.
      Something I didn't think about is that libraries can be less future proof than plain javascript, however I also believe that no website/app/software is immune to this 
      problem since software is always changing. The model view controller framework I have found to have some great uses, but also be quite a lot of work to set up like we 
      are currently doing in another class. The rest is all useful and there are some things in there I can use in the future.
